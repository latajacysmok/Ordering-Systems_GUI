# Ordering-Systems_GUI
A simple ordering system in which you can choose the number of red, white or other wines,
set the price per piece. From the calculated amount for the goods,
we can calculate the tax on our purchases, the total price with tax and the price without tax.
In addition, we can enter the name of the customer, his telphone number and email.
We can also give the customer his individual number.
When we start to fill in the date, we display the current date and time.
Finally, we have the exit function and the data reset.
